Use java to compute ffs (Java)
===============================================

Detail: read and write xls using apache POI, compute fft using FFT Columbia

To see result, cd into fft_res. The excel file is fft result while res_pic folder contains frequency domain graph (frequency unit /min).

To run, simply open fft and run in eclipse. It will read excel file, compute fft and write new excel file. 

future work..

The running time need to refine for real big fft case, future work will focus on speed-up.
